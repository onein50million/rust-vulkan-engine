# rust-vulkan-engine
untitled-gsg is an untitled grand strategy game about the world after a 76m rise in sea level

Some interesting features:
* PBR lighting
* Clouds done with real time ray-tracing (although the real performance killer is actually the noise generation)
* Seasonal temperature shifts
* The beginnings of a population and market simulation
